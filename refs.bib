	abstract = {Although the interest of a Web page is strictly related to its content and to the subjective readers' cultural background, a measure of the page authority can be provided that only depends on the topological structure of the Web. {PageRank} is a noticeable way to attach a score to Web pages on the basis of the Web connectivity. In this article, we look inside {PageRank} to disclose its fundamental properties concerning stability, complexity of computational scheme, and critical role of parameters involved in the computation. Moreover, we introduce a circuit analysis that allows us to understand the distribution of the page score, the way different Web communities interact each other, the role of dangling pages (pages with no outlinks), and the secrets for promotion of Web pages.},

	abstract = {Human societies are based on cooperation among large numbers of genetically unrelated individuals. This behavior is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective. Because cooperators are unrelated it cannot be the result of kin selection, and the large scale seems to preclude explanations based on direct reciprocity. Alexander (1987) has proposed that large-scale cooperation among humans can be understood as resulting from networks of “indirect” reciprocity. For example, individual A may help individual B even though A receives no direct reciprocal benefit. Instead, B might help C who helps D who finally returns the help indirectly to A. Here we describe a simple mathematical model of the evolution of indirect reciprocity. Analysis of this model suggests that indirect reciprocity is unlikely to be important unless interacting groups are fairly small.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the analysis of the factors influencing the evolution of neocortex size in primates given in Dunbar (1992) is extended in three specific ways. (1) An independent test is undertaken of the hypothesis that group size is a function of relative neocortex size in primates by using estimates of neocortex size to predict group size for those species that were not involved in the original analysis. The results confirm the results of the earlier analysis. (2) A more satisfactory test is attempted of the alternative hypothesis that species which differ in the degree of extractive foraging also differ in relative neocortex size. This particular version of the hypothesis is rejected. (3) These results are used to identify the "cognitive" group size for those species of baboons that live in multi-layered social systems.},

	abstract = {Darwinian evolution has to provide an explanation for cooperative behaviour. Theories of cooperation are based on kin selection (dependent on genetic relatedness),, group selection and reciprocal altruism. The idea of reciprocal altruism usually involves direct reciprocity: repeated encounters between the same individuals allow for the return of an altruistic act by the recipient. Here we present a new theoretical framework, which is based on indirect reciprocity and does not require the same two individuals ever to meet again. Individual selection can nevertheless favour cooperative strategies directed towards recipients that have helped others in the past. Cooperation pays because it confers the image of a valuable community member to the cooperating individual. We present computer simulations and analytic models that specify the conditions required for evolutionary stability of indirect reciprocity. We show that the probability of knowing the 'image' of the recipient must exceed the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act. We propose that the emergence of indirect reciprocity was a decisive step for the evolution of human societies.},

But many biological systems, and especially human societies, are organized around altruistic, cooperative interactions. How can natural selection promote unselfish behaviour? Various mechanisms have been proposed, and a rich analysis of indirect reciprocity has recently emerged: I help you and somebody else helps me.
