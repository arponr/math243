To check:

Analysis:
    less iterations for PageRank
    Different restrictions for different individuals, linear cost for more iterations
Knowledge:
    Only know some of the interactions, linear cost for knowing more
    Only know an induced subgraph of interactions, quadratic cost for larger subgraph
Reproduction:
    Reset reputation
    mutation rate/what to mutate
    mutate by reset with some chance or by adding a random amount
Strategy:
    probability of errors#
    most general--function from reputation to probability
Selection:
    Make weak#
