Modifications of PageRank
 - limited iterations
 - different limitations per-person (evolutionary parameter?)
 - PageRank subgraph
Different strategies
 - probabilistic vs. threshold
 - functional probabilistic (ouch)
Fitness calculation
 - weaker selection
 - penalize for higher computational power
