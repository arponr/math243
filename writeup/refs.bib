In this article, we look inside {PageRank} to disclose its fundamental properties concerning stability, complexity of computational scheme, and critical role of parameters involved in the computation. Moreover, we introduce a circuit analysis that allows us to understand the distribution of the page score, the way different Web communities interact each other, the role of dangling pages (pages with no outlinks), and the secrets for promotion of Web pages.},

	abstract = {Human societies are based on cooperation among large numbers of genetically unrelated individuals. This behavior is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective. Because cooperators are unrelated it cannot be the result of kin selection, and the large scale seems to preclude explanations based on direct reciprocity. Alexander (1987) has proposed that large-scale cooperation among humans can be understood as resulting from networks of “indirect” reciprocity. For example, individual A may help individual B even though A receives no direct reciprocal benefit. Instead, B might help C who helps D who finally returns the help indirectly to A. Here we describe a simple mathematical model of the evolution of indirect reciprocity. Analysis of this model suggests that indirect reciprocity is unlikely to be important unless interacting groups are fairly small.},

(1) An independent test is undertaken of the hypothesis that group size is a function of relative neocortex size in primates by using estimates of neocortex size to predict group size for those species that were not involved in the original analysis. The results confirm the results of the earlier analysis. (2) A more satisfactory test is attempted of the alternative hypothesis that species which differ in the degree of extractive foraging also differ in relative neocortex size. This particular version of the hypothesis is rejected. (3) These results are used to identify the "cognitive" group size for those species of baboons that live in multi-layered social systems.},

Cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived that specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.},

	abstract = {Darwinian evolution has to provide an explanation for cooperative behaviour. Theories of cooperation are based on kin selection (dependent on genetic relatedness),, group selection and reciprocal altruism. The idea of reciprocal altruism usually involves direct reciprocity: repeated encounters between the same individuals allow for the return of an altruistic act by the recipient. Here we present a new theoretical framework, which is based on indirect reciprocity and does not require the same two individuals ever to meet again. Individual selection can nevertheless favour cooperative strategies directed towards recipients that have helped others in the past. Cooperation pays because it confers the image of a valuable community member to the cooperating individual. We present computer simulations and analytic models that specify the conditions required for evolutionary stability of indirect reciprocity. We show that the probability of knowing the 'image' of the recipient must exceed the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act. We propose that the emergence of indirect reciprocity was a decisive step for the evolution of human societies.},

	abstract = {Theory of indirect reciprocity is important in explaining cooperation between humans. Since a partner of a social interaction often changes, an individual should assess his partner by using social information such as reputation and make decisions whether to help him or not. To those who have `good' social reputation does a player give aid as reciprocation, whereas he has to refuse to help those who have `bad' reputation. Otherwise benefits of altruism is easily exploited by them. Little has been known, however, about the definition of `goodness' in reputation. What kind of actions are and should be regarded as good and what kind of actions bad? And what sort of goodness enables sustaining exchange of altruism? We herein challenge this question with an evolutionary perspective. We generalize social reputation as {`Honor-score'} {(H-score)} and examine the conditions under which individuals in a group stably maintain cooperative relationships based on indirect reciprocity. We examine the condition for evolutionarily stable strategies {(ESSs)} over 4096 possible cases exhaustively. Mathematical analysis reveals that only eight cases called `leading eight' are crucial to the evolution of indirect reciprocity. Each in the leading eight shares two common characteristics: (i) cooperation with good persons is regarded as good while defection against them is regarded as bad, and (ii) defection against bad persons should be regarded as a good behavior because it works as sanction. Our results give one solution to the definition of goodness from an evolutionary viewpoint. In addition, we believe that the formalism of reputation dynamics gives general insights into the way social information is generated, handled, and transmitted in animal societies.},

We propose a method based on this idea, which is also used by well-known ranking algorithms, discuss its properties as well as experimental results and compare them to other reputation mechanisms for electronic communities supported by agents. The method proposed uses only local information in order to extract reputation and it is able to adapt automatically to the topology of the network or graph.},
